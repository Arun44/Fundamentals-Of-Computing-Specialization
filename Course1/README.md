### WEEK 2 - Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizard-Spock Game

<p align="left">
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties against itself.In our first mini-project, we will build a Python function 𝚛𝚙𝚜𝚕𝚜(𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎) that takes as input the string 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎, which is one of "𝚛𝚘𝚌𝚔", "𝚙𝚊𝚙𝚎𝚛", "𝚜𝚌𝚒𝚜𝚜𝚘𝚛𝚜", "𝚕𝚒𝚣𝚊𝚛𝚍", or "𝚂𝚙𝚘𝚌𝚔". The function then simulates playing a round of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock by generating its own random choice from these alternatives and then determining the winner.

### WEEK 3 - Guess The Number

<p align="left">
One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”. The first player thinks of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. In this project, you will build a simple interactive program in Python where the computer will take the role of the first player while you play as the second player.

### Week 4 - Stop Watch

<p align="left">
Our mini-project for this week will focus on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch should contain "Start", "Stop" and "Reset" buttons.
